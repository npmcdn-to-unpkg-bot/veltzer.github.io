- remove the gh-pages support in my makefiles and rely
	on the support in templar but pass the branch to which to push.

- use pdmt for this project and get ridd of the makefile altogether.
- make a better favicon for this project.
- we are running htmlhint(1) wrong and supressing all of its output.
	fix this.
