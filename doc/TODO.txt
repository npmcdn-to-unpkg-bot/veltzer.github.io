now:
- use github javascript API to show all of my projects instead of the hardcoded code.

build todos:
- use pdmt for this project and get ridd of the makefile altogether.

total goals:
- use angular js and models to show:
	all the companies that I taught.
	all the certifications that I have.
	all the courses that I taught.
	all my links.
	my basic info.
